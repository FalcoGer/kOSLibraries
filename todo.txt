math scripts:

- calculate DV for stage
- calculate total DV
- calculate hohman DV
- calculate time for fixed dV maneuver (a = thrust / mass, integral over mass change for the burn)

maneuver scripts:
orbital:
- hohman transfer (change AP, circularize)
- circularize
- inclination change (including burn to higher orbit for efficiency)
- orbital period change
- do contract orbit

body:
- ascend guidance w/ profile (target speeds, max AoA)
- go to child body, possibly with inclination and pereapsis height

target:
- intercept target (orbital period change, wait, kill relative)
- kill relative velocity
- docking
- match inclination
- match orbit
