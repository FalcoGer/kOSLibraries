misc scripts:

- timewarp to specific time/for specified amount of time

ship scripts:

- calculate DV for stage, including multi engine and mixed engine
- calculate total DV
- get isp of all engines combined for stage
- get total thrust of all engines
- auto deploy/retract solar/comms
- auto deploy/retract gear/lights
- throttle stepping to prevent overshoot: THROTLE = 1 - (current / target * 0.99) (eg current = SHIP:APOAPSIS, target = 100_000e3)

aircraft:
- fly to waypoint
- autoland
- set altitude (pid)
- set heading  (pid)
- set speed    (pid)

maneuver scripts:
orbital:
- calculate hohman DV
- hohman transfer (change AP, circularize), (burn for DV1 time, burn for DV2 time)
- circularize
- inclination change (including burn to higher orbit for efficiency)
- orbital period change
- calculate orbital period: t = 2pi * SQRT(SMA^3 / MU)
- do contract orbit (enter arguments from contracts)
- calculate time for fixed dV maneuver t = g0 * M0 * Isp * (1 - e^(-dV / (g0*Isp))) / F   ; where g0 grav. const, M0 starting mass, F = thrust
- calculate time for fixed dV maneuver with staging
- execue node

body:
- ascend guidance w/ profile (target speeds, max AoA)
- go to child body, possibly with inclination and pereapsis height
- descend guidance
- landing descend (PID controller controlling vertical speed)
- landing w/ coordinates
- time to suicide burn (use fixed dv maneuver time, calculate speed at different heights, equate, solve for height)
- time to impact: d = v0 * t + (a*t^2)/2, solve for t: t = (SQRT(v^2 + 2*g*d) - v) / g     ; where v = initial velocity, g = surface gravity, d = distance to surface.
- get surface gravity: g = mu / radius^2

target:
- intercept target (orbital period change, wait, kill relative)
- intercept target with hohman transfer at best time to meet with target at new AP/PE
- kill relative velocity
- docking
- match inclination
- match orbit
- time to closest
- Angle to target (orbital angle that the target is ahead of current vessel)


notes:
SMA: Semi Major Axis: Average distance PA and AP from center of body (not sea level), determines orbital period
