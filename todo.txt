misc scripts:

- timewarp to specific time

math scripts:

- calculate DV for stage, including multi engine and mixed engine
- calculate total DV
- calculate hohman DV
- get isp of all engines combined for stage
- get total thrust of all engines
- calculate time for fixed dV maneuver t = g0 * M0 * Isp * (1 - e^(-dV / (g0*Isp))) / F, g0 grav. const, M0 starting mass, F = thrust
- calculate time for fixed dV maneuver with staging

maneuver scripts:
orbital:
- hohman transfer (change AP, circularize)
- circularize
- inclination change (including burn to higher orbit for efficiency)
- orbital period change
- do contract orbit

body:
- ascend guidance w/ profile (target speeds, max AoA)
- go to child body, possibly with inclination and pereapsis height

target:
- intercept target (orbital period change, wait, kill relative)
- intercept target with hohman transfer at best time to meet with target at new AP/PE
- kill relative velocity
- docking
- match inclination
- match orbit
- time to closest
